## **Abstract**

This is a solution for the [The Winton Stock Market Challenge Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-winton-stock-market-challenge).

Since predicting stock market returns is notoriously hard, we will expect it to be difficult to beat
a naive baseline model of just predicting mean returns of the training period. Also, since this is a
*hiring competition* we will suspect the data set has been created in such a way, that dealing with
important factors such as missing value imputation, numerical vs categorical features, colinearity,
normalization, grouping and model robustness will be essential for competitors to demonstrate adequate
skillsets in. Also, we note that we are here to win a Kaggle competition - not to make an actually viable 
trading algorithm. 

There where <font color=green>832</font> teams participating in the Kaggle competition. This solution has a Private Score of <font color=green>1727.86647</font> and
a Public Score of <font color=green>1769.92199</font> and would have ranked as number <font color=green>4</font> (top <font color=green>0.5%</font>) on the Private Leaderboard.
